            <description>Introduction Potentially the best place to build illumos is on OmniOS. OmniOS is similarly situated in terms of it&amp;rsquo;s closeness to gate. Pull down OmniOS and install it on whatever virtual or physical platform desired.
OmniOS Download
Once booted into OmniOS, lets install the necessary tools and pull down the illumos-gate repository.
Install Dev Tools # pkg update # pkg install pkg:/developer/illumos-tools Clone the illumos-gate Repository # mkdir /code # cd /code # git clone https://github.</description>

<p>If you will be posting a patch to illumos-gate for review or building for another reason, you will want to see if the changes and build completed successfully.
The location of the the logs will be in /code/illumos-gate/log
A summary is saved in /code/illumos-gate/log/latest/mail_msg</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash}" data-lang="{.bash}"> # tail -f /code/illumos-gate/log/nightly
 # cat /code/illumos-gate/log/mail_msg
</code></pre><h3 id="git-pbchk">git-pbchk</h3>
<p>Another part of submitting a patch to illumos is sumbmitting the results of git-pbchk.</p>

            <description>Introduction Welcome to my blog. Here I will share my experiences as well as my wins and losses as it pertains to software, virtualization, operating systems, infrastructure, and networking.
The goal is to share information on topics and help spread the adoption of open source Unix systems, such as illumos and potentially FreeBSD.
In the coming weeks, I would like to document bug fixes and create packages for others to use for the wider adoption of illumos specifically.</description>

<p>In the coming weeks, I would like to document bug fixes and create packages for others to use for the wider adoption of illumos specifically.
Primary topics and tags will be illumos, Real-Time Communications, Rust, C, Virtualization, Zones, ZFS, and others.</p>
